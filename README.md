## My process
  1. I've started with HTML:5 a command to add strucutre to HTML available on VS Code
  2. After that i've gone add the fonts where i put on HTML;
  3. After i've added the CSS structure by writing "link" and select "link:css". I did that 3 times to add CSS Reset, Style and Response.
  4. To the next step i've gone to add the body strucutre. Where i added <main> with "container" class attribute and within it i add a <div> with a class named "card" with 3 other elements: img and 2 paragraph.
  5. I've put the image first, then all other text sequentially.
  6. After that i reset the default brownser style with: Margin: 0; Padding: 0; Box-Sizing: Border-Box;
  7. So i was to CSS Styles where i started adding font-family in body;
  8. I added the style to <main> and increase it size to fill all the screen with: VW and VH. I've put the display to flex just to justify and align the content and items; and added the corresponding color mentioned at the style guide;
  9. Now i've stylized the card adding a width (300px) looks like the image inside /designer (maybe i wrote wrong width) and a auto height; Added a gap for spacing and a border radius to stylization. I've added a 15px on padding; added a display flex to organize the content and a flex-diretion column to put the items one under other;
  10. Alright here i've just trying to find the correctly width for the image. But i prefer to find the text size from paragraphs first. When i finally find it i've organized the image.
